1. Setting Up Express:

You created an Express application using express().
Configured the server to listen on port 3000.

2. Defining User Data:

I have a userArray that contains user data that I placed for demonstration of this project.

3. Handling Requests:

GET: Responds with a welcome message or a predefined message.
POST: Accepts user data from the request body and sends it back in the response.
PUT: Accepts user ID as a parameter and user data from the body, then returns the updated data (logic to update the userArray is missing).
DELETE: Accepts user ID as a parameter and sends a message (logic to delete from the userArray is missing).

4. Repetitions:

There are redundant route definitions and multiple app.post handlers, which could be simplified."# project-3"
